"What problems is the AI act solving? Technological solutionism, fundamental rights, and trustworthiness in European AI policy","Bao-Chau Pham , Sarah R. Davies ",2024,"Artificial intelligence (AI) policy has been a key topic in public and political discourse for some time. Mobilizing Bacchi’s ‘What’s the problem represented to be?’ framework, we critically explore the policy responses to AI presented by the European Commission, the problem representations that are assumed within and justify these particular responses, and the wider effects of such problematizations. We find that EU AI policy constitutes the technology as both opportunity and threat, and that these problematizations demand a specific policy response – the risk-based categorizations of the AI Act – that allows these different imaginations of AI to cohere. In addition, we argue that one effect of these problematizations is the enactment of particular versions of Europe and Europeanness. In proposing a specific policy solution, European AI policy enacts not only AI but an exceptionalist notion of Europe as a policy actor and coherent political community.",Artificial intelligence  European Union  policy solution  problematization Artificial intelligence,Europeana,Public Domain
The Myth of Artifical Intelligence,Erik J. Larson,2021,"Larson argues that AI hype is both bad science and bad for science. A culture of invention thrives on exploring unknowns, not overselling existing methods. Inductive AI will continue to improve at narrow tasks, but if we want to make real progress, we will need to start by more fully appreciating the only true intelligence we know—our own.","Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, General Intelligence, Cognitive Science, AI Limitations, Knowledge Representation, Common Sense Reasoning, Computational Limits, Human vs. Machine Thinking",Open library,Public Domain
Artificial intelligence and moral rights,"Martin Miernick,  Irene Ng",2020,"Whether copyrights should exist in content generated by an artificial intelligence is a frequently discussed issue in the legal literature. Most of the discussion focuses on economic rights, whereas the relationship of artificial intelligence and moral rights remains relatively obscure. However, as moral rights traditionally aim at protecting the author’s “personal sphere”, the question whether the law should recognize such protection in the content produced by machines is pressing; this is especially true considering that artificial intelligence is continuously further developed and increasingly hard to comprehend for human beings. This paper first provides the background on the protection of moral rights under existing international, U.S. and European copyright laws. On this basis, the paper then proceeds to highlight special issues in connection with moral rights and content produced by artificial intelligence, in particular whether an artificial intelligence itself, the creator or users of an artificial intelligence should be considered as owners of moral rights. Finally, the present research discusses possible future solutions, in particular alternative forms of attribution rights or the introduction of related rights.",Copyrights  Moral rights  Artificial Intelligence  Authorship  Attribution  Contributorship Artificial intelligence,Europeana,Public Domain
